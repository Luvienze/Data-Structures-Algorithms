I decided to add a README file when i read a chapter in book and tell what i learned from to codes.

1/Compressed Gene
This algorithm looks a bit complex but basically it converts char to byte from String type input.

2/Fibonacci
Fibonacci algorithm inspired me a lot. There are many ways to solve math problems and we can choose the way we want.
For example when i started to coding i definetly choose the fib1 cause it's too short and easy to understand. But after 
this solution i say that fib4  way to solve fibonacci is very cool :D. It's like binary search actually what i mean is
we generally use temp for binary search and we use this format in fib4 way. It's optimal and we can enter any number we want.

3/Unbreakable Encryption
This is the hardest to understand the algorithm to code in this chapter for me.Approaching step by step is important for this one.
First, we create a key pair that which one is our original one and the other one is copy.
Then we create a method that get original's key lenght as a parameter and uses it for copy key.
After that , we get the original bytes, create a dummy key with using original's one lenght and create a new array with original's one lenght with XOR gates.
And the end, we call the encrypted array to decrypt it.
I'm still strugling to understand the decryt method and for honest i couldn't write a code like this right now. I can understand what's going on but it's not easy to 
write a code likte this for me .

4/Pi Calculator
We use Leibniz formula for find the solution to calculating pi. It's quite simple to understand and write.
With the help of for loop we write 4/n and continue it. 

5/ The Towers of Hanoi
After solving the Hanoi, i'm thinking that everybody should see the hanoi towers for learning algorithms and data structures. 
We create three towers in Stack, create three discs and put the discs in the first tower. After that we create a move method.
Understand to move method i drawed the hanoi towers on paper and solved it. In order:
1.We take the small disc to tower C 
2.we take the middle dics to tower B and place to small disc on it (int n == 1)
3.We take the large disc to tower C and place the other discs top on of it.

I'm learning the Java and oop and i can say that after i learned encapsulation, the "solve" method is such a beatiful example of encapsulation.
Finally, in main method we just call the solve method and print the towers.

There's a link in book for a better way to solving The Towers of Hanoi. I'm dropping it in here, in this code it uses 6 discs and it complicates the solution.
